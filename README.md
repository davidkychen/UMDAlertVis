# UMDAlertVis

This is a course project aiming to visualize the crimes happened near the University of Maryland campus.

At university of Maryland, we had an alert system from the police department, which sends alerts when there is a serious crime happened and students are involved. However, alerts are all text contents so even though they provide the place the crime happened, it was still hard for people to know exactly where the crime happened. The project was to crawl the data in those alerts and retrieved the specific information, such as day, time, address, and crime.
